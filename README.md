# hash-distribution-functions-
This program uses the boost c++ library. To calculate the chi squared distribution and calculate the p value.

This program demonstrates the distribution of five different hashing techniques by taking a word file of approximately 99171 words. The program will hash the strings into 16-bit ints.

The hashing techniques used in this program are taking the string length, the first character, adding the character values together, the remainder method, and then the Multiplicative method.

The program will display the histograms and p value obtained in the terminal. The terminal should be in fullscreen to view the graphs accurately. The y axis represents the number of times a word is in an interval and the x axis represents the interval.
